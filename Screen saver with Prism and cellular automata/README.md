# Screen saver with Prism and cellular automata
There is a code for the post https://ireznykov.com/2017/01/29/screen-saver-with-prism-and-cellular-automata/

#Abstract
The post is devoted to the application that is complete screen saver. Sure, screen saver is quite old technology, and there is no necessity to use it on modern displays. But from my point of view moving objects on display until computer fall to sleep looks better than stable background picture.

The application bases on the idea of mathematical objects modelling application, as it could provide interesting visual patterns. This version uses 2D closed cellular automaton, and it could be iterated in natural way. These automata are quite interesting, and you can read more about it in Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton" target="_blank">Cellular automaton</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Conway's Game of Life</a>.

The application provides settings that controls size and colors of cells and current automaton algorithm. Statistics views could be shown on the main window. There are line chart with series of born, died and total amount of cells; and column chart with distribution of cells per their age. As the application is a screen saver, it exits at any key or left mouse click, but user may use context menu to show/hide statistics and restart automaton.
